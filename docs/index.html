<h3>Python Data Extractpr</h3>

This page contains links to some samples of processed datafiles.

Color and tooltip descriptions are provided to give details on how text has been parsed.

Note: the two multi-line files are really, really long - produced to learn lessons about the parsing performance. Each took around 5 seconds to parse/label.

<ol>
    <li><b><a href="track_lines.html">Multiple event types</a></b> This example illustrates
        how multiple types of event have been extracted form the file.  We have shaded each 
        type of field in a unique color.  Also note that the last field in the <b>951212</b>
         lines has been processed by multiple files. Hover over the <b>10</b> at the end of
        first line to see the list of tools that have processed that value. Oh, it also includes
        a color key</li>
     <li><b><a href="nmea.html">Fields across muliple lines</a></b> In this example, one
    row of data is spread across several lines of the input data format. The discrete fields
    that were used to collate a row of data have been highlighted</li>
    <li><b><a href="nmea2.html">Lines across muliple lines</a></b> In this example, one
        row of data is spread across several lines of the input data format. Whole lines that
    contributed to a row of output data were highlighted in this file</li>
        </ol>
